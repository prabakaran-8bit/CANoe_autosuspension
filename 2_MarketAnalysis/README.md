# Market analysis
## My Version
* The advanced version present today(Adaptive M) works on many sensors and align the suspension accordingly but my version includes only a gyroscope and and aligns the chasis in the opposite direction of the angle deviated by the gyroscope that is placed  in the centre body of the car
* The cost spend in sensing area of adaptive suspension can be reduced significantly
* Due to cost reduction adaptive suspension can be introduced in budget segment cars
* Switching of modes is not required as it has been automated

* Active suspension with MHEV drivetrain electromechanical suspension system, which drives each wheel individually and adapts to the prevailing road conditions. Each    wheel has an electric motor which is powered by the 48-volt main electrical system. Additional components include gears, a rotary tube together with internal titanium torsion bar and a lever which exerts up to 1,100 Nm (811.3 lb-ft) on the suspension via a coupling rod.
* It is available in Audi A8 series

* The E-Active Body Control suspension is based on the AIRMATIC air suspension system, the latter comprising of regular components like air springs, air compression chamber and height control valves. The E-Active system adds hydropneumatics to this package, that comprises of two specialised on-board computers, a hydraulic pump and sensors to detect body movement. The hydropneumatics draw power from the carâ€™s 48V mild hybrid system
* It is available in GL300d and GL400d HipHop edition
